	*Number of TCP connections was determined by getting the ACK and SYN flag values and comparing them. If they both equal 1, a connection is found.
	*ACK and SYN flag values were found in the Control bits section of TCP header using Python's bitewise

Number of TCP Connections =  3 

Connection 1
----------------
	*Source Port, Source IP, Dest Port, and Dest IP were all found starting from byte value 26 on in the buffer.
	*Wireshark helped with finding the exact placement of these values in the buffer.

Source Port:  43498 | Source IP 130.245.145.12 | Destination Port:  80 | Destination IP:  128.208.2.198

	*Throughput is measured by first checking if the packet's source IP is equal to the sender IP defined in the assignment pdf
	*Then we mark a starting timestamp using that packets timestamp, and loop through all the values that meet this above condition
	*As the loop goes on, the bytes size appends the respective packets' sizes.
	*We keep moving the end timestamp along the loop so it reaches the last packet checked.
	*Finally, divide the total bytes appended by the (end-start) for time to get the throughput

Sender throughput (bytes over time):  5251354.304335755

	*Now we look at the first two transactions after the connection is made and grab the seq_number, ack_number, and window size from the buffer
	*Window scale was found to be 3 (multiply by 16,384)

Sequence number:  705669103 |Acknowledgement number:  1921750144 |Window:  49152
Sequence number:  705669103 |Acknowledgement number:  1921750144 |Window:  49152

	*Congestion happens when sequence numbers get backed up in the buffer, so I kept track of sequence that get sent repeatedly
	*Then when an ack number finally gets thrown back, at this point take the sequence number (Last kept track of) and subtract the ack number
	*If this is a positive number, you have an amount of packets that caused congestion, hence the congestion window
	*The congestion window seems to steadily grow here, but as seen in the following connections, it doesn't necessarily follow a pattern

Congestion window:  11584
Congestion window:  13032
Congestion window:  14480

	*For retransmissions due to 3-duplicate ack, simply keep track of the ack numbers in 3 different arrays
	*Always depend to array1 by default, but if the ack number is in array1, append to array2
	*If the ack number is in array1 and array2, add to array3 (this is a triple duplicate ack). 
	*Return the length of this third array
	
Triple Duplicate Ack retransmissions: 2


	*The rest of this .txt file is the remaining output of the code
